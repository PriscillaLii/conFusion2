Description and Something I wanna say:


Individual, Personal Project

Developed website that contains: menu, dish detail and comments, contact information, leadership and awards, etc.
Created functions that support user login, adding comments, adding feedback, showing featured items.
Used AngularJS as the architecture of this website. Used JSON-Server to store and distribute data.

PS: Some data is still in this file because I haven't transfered all the data yet.
Json-server data: github.com/PriscillaLii/conFusion-Data
